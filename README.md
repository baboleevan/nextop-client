# Nextop Mobile CDN

Nextop is rethinking a CDN for mobile from the ground up. Mobile devices operate in high latency and
 uncertain networks, and Nextop is able to optimize traffic to get content displayed to
 users >2x faster than leading CDNs, while never losing a transaction.

The core technology is a client SDK that replaces or plugs into your existing network library,
and a proxy server that translates between the SDK and your existing HTTP backend.

With this setup, for example, Nextop can load image previews and
blocking API calls before loading everything else for a view. As a developer you
 write network code and server code as you normally would, and Nextop takes care
 of optimizing all requests to get content displayed to the user faster.

Nextop is a cross-platform project, with Android, iOS, and webviews as top priorities.
