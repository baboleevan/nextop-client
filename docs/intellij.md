# IntelliJ / Android Studio Usage

Nextop has embedded idea projects, so you should be able to just open the nextop-client directory
 in IntelliJ and get going.

The team uses IntelliJ, which I think is compatible with Android Studio,
but if there are issues with Android Studio, [please submit an issue](https://github.com/nextopio/nextop-client/issues).
